## 🤖 Overview

**Robotick** is a high-performance, modular C++ runtime for robotics and control systems - engineered for reliability, introspection, and composability across the full spectrum of platforms.

From bare-metal microcontrollers like the STM32 and ESP32 to Raspberry Pi, desktop systems, and edge-AI devices like NVIDIA Jetson (arm64), Robotick delivers real-time precision where it counts, and excellent performance everywhere else - without sacrificing ease of use or flexibility.

## 🚀 What is Robotick?

Robotick is a modern control engine designed to execute structured workloads with:

- Predictable, real-time performance
- Introspectable config, input, and output fields
- Zero-allocation memory buffer layout
- Modular composition and orchestration
- Full lifecycle management (load, start, tick, stop)
- Remote telemetry and future remote control

Built for early learners and industry professionals alike, Robotick is simple enough for educational bots and sophisticated enough for serious research and development.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 Modular Workloads
Each unit of logic is a workload - a small, testable module with clearly defined inputs, outputs, and config:
```cpp
struct HelloWorkload {
    HelloConfig config;
    HelloInputs inputs;
    HelloOutputs outputs;

    void tick(double dt);
};
```
Reflection macros make every field visible and usable for config, scripting, or telemetry.

### 🔁 Real-Time Engine
- Individual tick rates per workload
- Deterministic scheduling
- Ready for multithreaded execution
- Exceptionally consistent timing on MCUs
- Excellent latency characteristics on general-purpose platforms

### 📦 Composition System
Compose workloads into rich behaviours:

- `SequenceWorkload`: run workloads in order
- `SyncedPairWorkload`: parallel aligned ticking
- Future: event-driven, reactive, and conditional branching

### 🔬 Introspection & Reflection
Every field in config, inputs, and outputs is exposed at runtime, enabling:

- Remote configuration
- Schema-aware scripting
- Full field inspection for telemetry

No boilerplate. No fuss. Just structured access to everything that matters.

### 📡 Remote Telemetry & UI
Designed for live telemetry from the start:

- Structured data streaming
- Pluggable transport backends (UART, MQTT, etc.)
- UI- and scripting-ready introspection
- Foundation for remote tuning and remote control

### 🐍 Python Bindings
Use Python to:

- Orchestrate workload execution
- Inspect and modify live system state
- Visualise real-time data
- Integrate with scientific workflows

Zero-copy overlay support is in progress for high-efficiency interop.

### 🧪 Simulation-First Testing
Built to be tested:

- Mockable physics interfaces
- Unit testable workloads
- Consistent simulated timing for verification
- Easy integration with CI

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Structured**: Everything is inspectable, composable, and testable
- **Reliable**: High-precision real-time behaviour on real hardware
- **Performant**: Zero-copy, buffer-based layout for speed and clarity
- **Accessible**: Easy for learners, powerful for researchers
- **Flexible**: Modular composition and optional Python integration
- **Embeddable**: Works standalone or embedded into larger stacks

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Python zero-copy memory overlay
- [ ] Live telemetry viewer (web + Python)
- [ ] Graphical workload visualiser
- [ ] Composition scripting and editor
- [ ] ROS2 integration bridge
- [ ] Official templates for STM32, Pi, Jetson
