# 🧩 Composition Workloads - Technical Design

Composition workloads in Robotick define how a group of child workloads are ticked in coordination. Each group sets its own tick cadence and governs how and when children are invoked.

---

## 🧠 Tick Policy

- A group’s tick rate defines the **maximum frequency** at which any of its children may tick.
- **Slower children** are allowed — they will be called only when their individual tick interval has elapsed.
- **Faster children are not allowed** — their tick opportunity is limited to the group’s cadence.
- Only **root workloads** can own a tick loop. All child groups are ticked by their parent.
- Each workload instance must belong to exactly one parent group or the Engine's root. This is enforced at setup. Adding a workload to multiple groups (even across threads) is a configuration error.

---

## ✅ `SequencedGroupWorkload`

**Deterministic sequential ticking** on a single thread.

### Characteristics
- All children tick one after another in a fixed order.
- Suitable for **MCUs** or minimal-thread environments (e.g. STM32 main loop).
- Fixed tick interval defines the loop rate.
- If total execution time exceeds the interval, the group logs an **overrun**.
- Per-child tick intervals are respected within the group loop.

### Timeline (Single Thread)
```
 Main Loop →
  ┌──── Tick A ──── Tick B ──── Tick C ────┐
  │                                        │
  └─────────────── sleep ──────────────────┘
```

## ✅ `SyncedGroupWorkload`

**Parallel child ticking** with coordinated timing.

### Characteristics
- All children tick in parallel at each group interval.
- Designed for **Linux / PC / Raspberry Pi** (>MCU) systems with threads or async runtimes.
- Per-child tick intervals are honoured; skipped if not yet due.
- Each child is **expected** to finish before the next group tick window, but **overruns are allowed**.
- If a workload overruns, it will **not delay** the group. It will continue running in the background and will be ticked again on the **next parent-tick after it completes**.
- Overruns are **logged per-child for debugging**, unless explicitly configured as expected (e.g. 1Hz console output).
- Serves as the **root tick barrier** in systems needing safe per-frame data movement.


## 🎞️ Execution Timeline Example

Demonstrates a `SyncedGroupWorkload` running at **1kHz**, with a mixture of child workloads:
- Some ticking at slower rates
- Some with longer execution times
- A child `SequencedGroup` with fixed-order inner ticks
- All ticks aligned to a central sync frame (safe barrier for data transfer)

## ✅ `McuSyncedPair` (interrupt + main loop)

**MCU-specific tick splitting** between a fast hardware-timed ISR and a slower main loop.

### Purpose
- Enables **precise periodic ticking** via a hardware timer interrupt.
- Allows the **main loop** to run less time-critical sequencing.
- Only **one interrupt-driven workload (or group)** is supported per timer.
- The main loop can still be logically "synced" — it observes the same base cadence, but runs slower if needed.

### Differences from `SyncedGroupWorkload`

| Aspect                         | `SyncedGroupWorkload`             | `McuSyncedPair`                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Platform                      | Linux / PC / Raspberry Pi         | MCU (e.g. STM32)                            |
| Parallel execution            | Threads / async                   | ISR + main loop                             |
| Max children per timing unit  | Multiple                          | One in ISR context                          |
| Scheduling base               | Software timers                   | Hardware timer interrupt                    |
| Overrun handling              | Logged per-child                  | Interrupt must return fast (no overrun logs)|
| Tick sync                     | True sync                         | Sync possible but looser (main may lag)     |

### Thread Model (MCU: ISR + main loop)
```
Timer ISR Thread →
                ┌ Tick SensorUpdate ┐   ┌ Tick SensorUpdate ┐

Main Loop Thread →
  ┌ Tick MainLogic (Seq Group) ┐     ┌ Tick MainLogic ┐

(Timer ISR runs fast & precise; Main loop ticks when it can)
```

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

- All workloads use **standard layout structs** — no virtual inheritance.
- Workload groups are configured with `set_children(...)`, which binds `WorkloadHandle`s to each group.
- Tick dispatch uses timestamps to determine whether a child is due (`now - last_tick >= interval`).
- Overrun detection to be reinstated for both `SequencedGroup` and `SyncedGroup`.

---

## 🧪 Design Rationale

- Keeps timing control **local to the group** while supporting mixed-frequency substructures.
- Avoids hidden tick escalations from children requesting higher frequencies than the parent can provide.
- Enables embedded (MCU) and high-level (threaded) systems to use a **unified scheduling abstraction**.
