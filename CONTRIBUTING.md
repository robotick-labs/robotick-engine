# 🤖 Contributing to Robotick

**Welcome - and thanks for your interest in contributing to Robotick!**

We’re building a modular, real-time robotics engine designed for reliability, introspection, and embedded performance.

Whether you're a seasoned robotics engineer, curious maker, or systems tinkerer - we’re glad you're here.

## ⚠️ Project Status

Robotick is currently in **active development**. While the codebase is public to support tools like [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) and foster transparency, we are not yet actively encouraging external contributions until the project stabilizes.

That said - feedback, questions, and ideas are very welcome! You can track progress and join the conversation via [Discussions](https://github.com/robotick-labs/robotick/discussions).

## 📜 Branching Strategy

We use a structured branching model to keep development stable and traceable.

### Main Branches

| Branch | Purpose                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| `main` | Stable, public-facing releases   |
| `dev`  | Active development and integration |

### Working Branches

Create new branches off `dev`, using a prefix that matches intent:

- `feature/your-feature` – new functionality
- `bugfix/issue-description` – bug fixes
- `docs/readme-update` – docs, guides, comments
- `meta/ci-change` – CI/config/tooling
- `experiment/your-idea` – short-term spikes or tests
- `spike/concept-name` – early-stage explorations

Avoid vague names like `test`, `tmp`, or `wip`.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo (if you're an external contributor)
2. Create your branch from `dev`
3. Make your changes (with comments, tests where possible)
4. Push and open a Pull Request (PR) into `dev`
5. Address feedback from CodeRabbit and human reviewers
6. Once approved, PRs are merged into `dev`
7. Periodically, `dev` is squash-merged into `main` for release

## ✅ PR Checklist

Before opening a PR, please check:

- [ ] Your branch follows naming conventions
- [ ] Your code builds cleanly and passes lint/CI
- [ ] Tests have been added (or reasons clearly explained)
- [ ] You’ve documented any new logic or behaviours
- [ ] CodeRabbit and reviewer comments are addressed

## 🤖 Code Review

We use **CodeRabbit** to help review PRs:

- It scans for potential bugs, style issues, and missing comments
- It may auto-approve safe, simple PRs - but human review is welcome and encouraged

We aim for reviews to be fast, respectful, and constructive.
